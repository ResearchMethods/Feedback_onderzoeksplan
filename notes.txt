* What does that mean?

	> What do all these fancy charts mean?

* Relevance section missing
	* It is actually there, in the background and problem sections
* Cover theoretical background more
	* Blockchain
	* Smart contracts
* Bibliography is good
* Do you need to mention literature review?
* Gantt chart: only finish-to-start used
	* Does not make sense in many cases
		* Scheduling
		* Logically
		* From description
* Planning good otherwise

# Dion Scheper

* Topic looks like a modern poem, maybe write a whole sentence (?)
* Problem description and Relevance are okay
* Improved: IRMA acronym is explained
* General: very informal, I do not know if that is bad
* Theoretical background: last paragraph matches relevance better
* Improved: actual name of strategy is used
* Method makes sense
* Planning should be more precise

	> een aantal maanden

* Gantt chart is missing (?)
* Bibliography: perfect starting at source 6, pretty bad before
