# Introduction

Your description of the topic is short and to the point. There wasn't much critique in the first place, but you incorporated the feedback you got.

# Relevance

The description of the relevance was good before, and it is still good. I do not have much to add here. As you say yourself, AES is important and very widely used. Society can only profit from better encryption.
