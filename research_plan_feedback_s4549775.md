# Introduction

Your description of the topic is short and to the point. There wasn't much critique in the first place, but you incorporated the feedback you got.

I think it is very helpful that you provide a short description of the Galois-Fields. I have heard from several people more familiar with the topic, that it is not easy to explain, and you do not go into much detail. This is completely fine though. In my opinion you struck a good balance between a detailed description, and not mentioning any information as before.

Also you wrote about what the function that you want to make up is actually supposed to do. As this is the main goal of your research, I feel like this is very important, and a good improvement.

After reading this, I am still no expert on AES encryption, and I do not need to be. I have a basic understanding of roughly what you are working on, and planning to do. It is also more clear now what your subquestions are, and that there is still value in solving some of the steps along the way, even if you should meet all your goals.

All in all you improved this part a lot, and I there is just one thing that is unclear to me. You say:

> Dat zou een probleem kunnen opleveren, omdat we in $GF(p)$ meer getallen hebben, dan maar twee.

Earlier you said:

> $GF(2^8)$ (bevat getallen van 0 t/m 255)

I do not understand that. Why is having more than two numbers a problem, if the currently used method uses 256? This may just be due to my ignorance on the topic though.

Apart form that, I think this is nicely done.

# Relevance

The description of the relevance was good before, and it is still good. I do not have much to add here. As you say yourself, AES is important and very widely used. Society can only profit from better encryption.

# Background

This was the section which you received the most feedback for, and you definitely improved it a lot. Now you actually provide information, instead of just saying "there is lots of information".

I am by no means an expert in cryptography, but because you provide an easy, cursory description of the different rounds, and the steps that are taken during the rounds, I have an idea of what you are going to do now. You were very unspecific before, but know, I have an idea of what you meant by converting the data to the correct format, and what your function needs to do.

Previous research is discussed in sufficient depth, and you are much more specific. The only thing I would still try to improve is your bibliography. You could use some more references, ideally peer reviewed articles.

# Method

This section has also been dramatically improved. Now you seem to actually have a plan to validate the security of your solution, and the reader knows what you want to do.

You make a few claims, that I am sure are true, but you give no reason why, or provide any evidence. You got these numbers from somewhere, so why don't you put the reference in your bibliography?

# Planning

This is the only area that still needs significant improvement, in my opinion. Your Gantt chart on the whole seems to be logical and thought through, though I am not convinced that less than a week will be enough to prove the algorithm correct **and** present your results. I am not really sure what you mean by "Make the article great again".

This is everything you have however. I think this can be improved by providing a few paragraphs paraphrasing your planning to underpin the Gantt chart, going into a bit more detail on what the activities mean (like "Analysing results"), and maybe provide some reasoning.

# General
